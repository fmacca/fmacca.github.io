## About Me

I am a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) researcher, with an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science background.
I am currently pursuing my PhD, where I am researching **Artificial Intelligence** methods for Orchestration. I am
interested in studying and developing tools for AI-assisted composition, and in conceiving models that can stimulate
a creative collaboration between a human artist and an AI. I like to build models with a solid music theoretical base,
and I devote a lot of effort to conceiving ways to represent these concepts in the computer.

I am interested in studying **orchestration** techniques with a computational approach. In particular I am investigating
the concept of *orchestral texture*, that I consider as a parameter with the same importance of melodic and harmonic
content in an orchestral work. I have been focusing on the classical era of western common practice.

In my thesis I mainly work with **symbolic representation of music**, like scores and MIDI files, but I am not unfamiliar
with sound waves, spectrograms, and digital signal processing methods for audio.

I am also interested in mathematical theories of tonal music and statistical analysis of social studies.
