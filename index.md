Hi, I'm **{{ site.title }}**, {{ site.description }}

## About Me

I am a researcher in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Digital Musicology, with a Statistics and Computer Science background. My
research interests revolve around digital musicology, MIR for music analysis, and generative music AI for human‑machine co‑creativity. I
am interested in using technology to respond to musicological problems, and in analyzing complex music data with Artificial Intelligence
(AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, adopting a Digital Humanities approach. I am also interested in studying Artificial Intelligence
(AI) as an entity integrated in a human creative process, acting either as a creativity‑enhancement tool or as an interactive co‑creative
partner.
